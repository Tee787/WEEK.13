Make and application that has an array that can hold 50 random numbers between 1 and 100. Display the contents of this array.

Extend your application so that it will use an Array Class method to find the index of one of the numbers that is displayed in your array.
(Hint: You need to find the index of the number your looking for.)

Extend the application to copy the array to a new array.

Extend your application to reverse the original array and display both the original and copied arrays.
